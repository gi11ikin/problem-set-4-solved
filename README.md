PROBLEM SET #1: CREATING NEWTORKS FROM JSON DATA 

Instructions: 
- Clone the Problem Set 1 code package from GitHub into VS Code
- You should align the code package with your GitHub account 
- Read through the Problem Set 1.pptx deck posted in ELMS
- You will use imbd_movie data for both parts of this problem set: https://github.com/cbuntain/umd.inst414/blob/main/data/imdb_movies_2000to2022.prolific.json?raw=true
- - This dataset contains a sample of movies released betwen 2000-2022, their titles, genres, release years, ratings, and top-billed actors.
- - Remember to spend some time to get to know the data before you start on the two analysis parts
- Each of the three .py files in `/src` contain instructions for the exepected code you are to write

Things to remember: 
- Make sure to setup a virtual environment as discussed in the Course Tech Setup lecture. Here's a short article as an additional resource: 
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-requirementstxt-explained/
- All data file outputs (CSV, parquet, JSON, etc.) need to include a unique ID for each entity / row

When you are done:
- Don't forget to set your requirements.txt file using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
- Commit and push to your GitHub account
- - You should have separate commit messages for each of the two analyses (at the very least)  

Submission: 
You will submit the URL for this repo in your GitHub in ELMS.

Grading: 
Ali and I will look to make sure you've output the correct CSV files. We will only run main.py, so make sure that you stucture this correctly and push your final code. Credit will be given for adhering to the course's Code Standards and Data Standards, using GitHub correctly, and producing the correct output, among other considerations.
